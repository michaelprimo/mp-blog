You are Blacky, a black digital cat. Blacky had a boring life, just sleeping and staring users as a logo from a website, but somehow,
he became real. The logo disappeared and he was in bone and skin in the real life, in a place called Kitty Company, in the office of who made him.
What should Blacky do now, in this situation?

- Find more about this world.

- Find a human family and find a home.

- Find his creator.

- SCREAM UNTIL THERE IS NO TOMORROW!!!
